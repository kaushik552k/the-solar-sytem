        <p class="h3">What is a Comet?</p>
        <br>
        <p>A meteor shower occurs when a number of meteors flash seem to radiate (or shoot out from) the same point in the sky. They are usually named for the constellation in which their radiant appears. The meteoroids in a shower usually come from the
            trail of debris left behind by a comet. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scatted by orbiting asteroids. When Earth’s orbit intersects the dust trail, we see more meteors flaring as the
            cometary debris encounters our planet’s atmosphere.</p><br><br>
        <p class="h3">Facts about Meteor Showers</p>
        <br>
        <!-- <p>There are many misconceptions about comets, which are simply pieces of solar system ices travelling in orbit around the Sun. Here are some fascinating and true facts about comets.</p><br><br> -->
        <ul>
            <li>Most meteor showers are caused by debris from comets. When Earth moves through those debris trails, we see increased numbers of comets.</li>
            <li>Two meteor showers are caused by debris shed by asteroids. The Quadrantids are very likely caused by debris from the minor planet 2003 EH1. The Geminid meteor shower comes from debris shed by asteroid 3200 Phaethon.</li>
            <li>The Orionid Meteor shower (which occurs in late October each year) is created by dust and debris left behind by the passage of Comet 1P/Halley.</li>
            <li>Meteors fall to Earth during the day, although we can’t see them.</li>
            <li>It is very rare that a meteorite will strike a human being. It’s more likely that it will fall into the ocean.</li>
            <li>The best time to view a meteor shower is in the early morning hours, preferably on a dark, moonless night.</li>
            <li>The earliest record of the Perseids meteor shower is found in Chinese annals from 36 AD.</li>

        <p class="h3">Famous Meteor Showers</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are several famous and easy-to-observe meteor showers. The Perseids occur in mid-August when Earth encounters the debris trail from Comet Swift-Tuttle. They appear to radiate from a point in the constellation Perseus. The shower lasts from
            mid-July to late August, with a peak around August 12th each year. <br><br> The Leonid meteor shower can be a very busy one. It occurs each year in mid-November, and rains debris from Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. In 1833, observers estimated that
            hundreds of thousands of meteors flared through the sky. Observers wait for it each year, hoping for another spectacular show, emanating from the direction of the constellation Leo.<br><br> The Geminid meteor shower occurs in December, when
            Earth crosses the path of the asteroid 3200 Phaethon. The meteors appear to come from the direction of the constellation Gemini, and observers have noted that they move more slowly than other meteors.<br><br> In late April, the Lyrids bring
            pieces of comet C/1861 G1/Thatcher back to Earth, which seem to radiate from the constellation Lyra. The peak of this storm is around April 22. Every 60 years or so this shower becomes more intense.</p><br><br>

        <!-- <p class="h3">Famous Comets</p>
        <br>
        <p>Well-known comets include the non-periodic comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), Hyakutake (C/1996 B2), McNaught (C2006 P1), and Lovejoy (C/2011 W3). These flared brightly in our skies and then faded into obscurity. <br><br> In addition, Comet Shoemaker-Levy
            9 (D/1993 F2) was spotted after it had broken up after a close call with Jupiter. (The D in its proper designation means it has disappeared or is determined to no longer exist). More than a year later, the pieces of the comet crashed into
            Jupiter. <br><br> The periodic Comet Halley (1P/Halley) is the most famous in history. It returns to the inner solar system once every 76 years. Other well-known periodic comets include 2P/Encke, which appears ever 3.3 years and 9P/Tempel
            (Tempel 2), which was visited by the Deep Impact and Stardust probes, and makes perihelion around the Sun every 5.5 years.</p><br><br> -->
